## What's This App About?

Hey there! Welcome to My Crypto App â€“ a cool little project I made to dive into the world of cryptocurrencies without getting lost. If you're like me, curious about all this crypto buzz and want to keep an eye on prices, maybe even try buying or selling some coins, you're in the right place!

## Features You'll Love

- **See Live Prices**: Wondering how Bitcoin or Ethereum are doing today? Check out the latest prices anytime, right from the app.

- **Buy and Sell Coins**: Got a hunch a coin's going to the moon? You can buy it here! Or if you think it's time to cash in, sell it just as easily.

- **Track Your Coins**: Keep an eye on what you've got in your digital wallet and see how your choices are performing.

## Stuff I Used to Make This

- **SwiftUI**: It's a neat way to make the app look pretty without tearing my hair out.
- **Combine**: This thing helps the app not get confused when lots of stuff is happening at once.
- **Core Data**: It's like the app's memory, remembering what you did last time you were here.
- **CryptoKit**: Keeps everything safe and secure, because no one likes sneaky hackers.
- **Some Web Stuff**: To grab all the latest prices and news from the internet.

## How to Get Started
